## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-10

Checkpoint 1 of 4: the Fellow client, configuration, and validation. No UI yet.

### Added

- Nuxt 4 project scaffold with lint, typecheck, Vitest, and msw tooling.
- Pure TypeScript Fellow client against the v2 cloud API: lazy single-flight
  login, refresh-token renewal with password fallback on 401, retries for GET
  and DELETE only, a 30-second read cache with in-flight de-duplication, and a
  dry-run mode that logs mutations instead of sending them.
- Zod schemas for brew profiles (including `overallTemperature`) and schedules,
  mirroring the reference validation rules, with lenient response types.
- brew.link import with drop types, share-link generation, exact or fuzzy
  profile lookup by title, remote Instant Brew start, and the readiness checks
  that gate it.
- Environment config loader validated once at startup.
- `GET /api/health`.
